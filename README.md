# LDA_Analysis
In this project, I implemented LDA analysis on two novels, Mrs Dalloway and Seasons of Migration. I discovered that both of the novels shared a few same clusters. I was able to derive a novel literary comparison between both texts by close reading the occurence of the words "kill" and "husband".
